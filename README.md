# Hackathon-2026
Our game was based off of redesigning and revamping the oregeon trail game. This game was redeveloped to become the WAZZU Trail where butch is on a mission to complete his senior year upon completing multiple tasks by making tough decisions. We had the same concepts as the oregeon trail as in the health and having other impacts that could potentially cause the user to lose. It was then adapted to fit the college path here at wsu and the goal is to make it to day 50 to finish your college career! We used the Microsoft LiveShare extension in VS code for us to all be able to edit the document at once and mitigate the amount of commits needed as well as have a more engaging team atmosphere.
